    this_project: 'I chose this project because I have children, and know how hard it can be to motivate them to help around the house.  Also, this project has potential to refactor into other similar incentive programs.  I contributed significantly to the initial set-up of the server and client sides application.  I also contribued to each stage of development, inluding back-end RUBY, front-end ReactJS, and styling using Semantic-UI-React and styled-components.'
